                There was a time when this wouldn't have bothered her. The fact that it did actually bother her bothered her <br>
                even more. What had changed in her life that such a small thing could annoy her so much for the entire day? She knew it <br>
                was ridiculous that she even took notice of it, yet she was still obsessing over it as she tried to fall asleep.
